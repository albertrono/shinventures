<p style="color: magenta">As I approached the party I could hear the blasting music all the way
    from the street. When I reached the back of the house to enter I could
    distinguish the song that was playing; it was It's good to be King by Tom
    Petty. After waiting in a line to enter I was finally in the loud, crowded
    house. Upon my arrival the host of the party informed me that there were no
    cups left, and that I would have to look for one. So I handed him my money as
    I was shoved into the next room by other arriving guest, eager to enter. Every
    person there was present for their own personal reasons. Whether these reason
    be social or simply for entertainment no one could tell. The only thing we all
    had in common was our goal to consume alcohol.
    As soon as I walked in the room I immediately could see and smell the
    smoke that was lingering in the air around the house. I was handed a cup by a
    friend. Looking into it to see if it had been used, we both shrugged and turned
    towards the basement. As I pushed my way through the crowd to look for the
    keg I immediately knew it was in the corner because of the crowd surrounding it.
    Once I reached the keg, I found myself waiting once again for my beer.</p>
